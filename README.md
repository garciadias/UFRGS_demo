# UFRGS git demo

## To download dataset from [kaggle-UFO](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/downloads/ufo-sightings.zip).
## To prepare the dataset run:

```
$ bash ./src/data/data.sh
```

## In this demo I'm explaining how to use git by performing the following steps:

- Create a repository
- Change the README.md file
- Create a branch to add a pair plot
- Merge it into master
- Create a second branch to replace the pair plot with a KDE plot
- Checkout to master and commit a title change to fabricate a conflict when
  merging the second branch into master
- Merge the second branch into master solving the conflict and adding the
  two plots to the final work
